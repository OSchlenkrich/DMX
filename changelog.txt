# Changelog Democracy Matrix V.4 (March 2021)
1. Updated to Varieties of Democracy Dataset V.11


# Changelog Democracy Matrix V.3 (July 2020)
1. Updated to Varieties of Democracy Dataset V.10
2. Replaced 0 in the dataset with 0.001 for mathematical reasons: We multiply the values of each matrix field to yield the institutional and dimensional index values. Therefore, 0 values lead to 0 index values, regardless of the values of the other matrix fields. We decided to replace  0 with 0.001 for each matrix field, so that the final index values is also influenced by the other values of the other matrix fields. 
3. New Classification Rule: 
    -Working Democracy: All values of the dimensional and institutional indices are above the threshold value of a functioning democracy 0.75.
    -Deficient Democracy: At least seven of the eight indices are above the democratic threshold value of 0.5, but at least one does not reach the     threshold value of a functioning democracy 0.75.
    -Hybrid Regime: At least one dimension and one institution are above the democratic threshold of 0.5, while the other indices are below the democratic threshold of 0.5. Or at least one dimension and one institution are below the democratic threshold of 0.5. The other indices are above the democratic threshold of 0.5.
    -Moderate Autocracy: At least seven of the eight indices are below the democratic threshold value of 0.5. At least one value from the dimension index and one value from the institutions index are above the threshold value of 0.25.
    -Hard Autocracy: Either all dimensional or all institutional indices are below the threshold value of 0.25.

1. Updated to Varieties of Democracy Dataset V.9

# Changelog Democracy Matrix V.1.1 (May 2019)

1. Fixed a problem with the variable v2elmulpar_ord which caused fluctuations in the time series for some countries.
2. Reduced the impact of context factors on core components from 0.5 to 0.75.
3. Fixed a problem when using Excel to open the datasets.
