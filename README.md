# Democracy Matrix (DeMaX)

The democracy matrix is a tool for measuring democratic quality. Drawing on data from the Varieties-of-Democracy-Project (V-Dem), the democracy matrix offers information for more than 170 countries in the period between 1900 and 2019. It came into being in the course of the DFG research project “The Democracy Matrix as an Alternative to the Democracy Indices of Freedom House and Polity: Implementation of the Varieties-of-Democracy-Data by Using the 15-Field-Matrix of Democracy” of the Chair of Comparative Politics and German Government at the University of Würzburg (https://www.politikwissenschaft.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/).
